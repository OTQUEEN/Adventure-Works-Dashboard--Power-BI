# Model performance check
As poor performance results in a negative user experience. I optimized the performance of the model by minizing the size of the model and also:
* Ensuring that the correct data types are used.
* Deleting unnecessary columns and rows.
* Avoiding repeated values.
* Replacing numeric columns with measures.
* Reducing cardinalities.
* Analyzing model metadata.
* Summarizing data where possible.
